### Jitter plot with `geom_jitter`

```{r test_jitter_plot}
library(plotly)
district_density <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/district_density.csv",
                             stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
district_density$cluster <- factor(district_density$cluster, levels=c("Pure urban", "Urban-suburban mix", "Dense suburban", "Sparse suburban", "Rural-suburban mix", "Pure rural"))
district_density$region <- factor(district_density$region, levels=c("West", "South", "Midwest", "Northeast"))

p <- ggplot(district_density,aes(x=cluster, y=dem_margin, colour=region)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(text=paste("district: ", cd_code)), width=0.25, alpha=0.5, ) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -30, hjust = 0.1)) +
  labs(title = "Democratic performance in the 2018 House elections, by region and density",
       x = "Density Index from CityLab",
       y = "Democratic Margin of Victory/Defeat")
fig <- ggplotly(p)

### Mapping
See: [Mapbox Layers in R](https://plotly.com/r/mapbox-layers/)

#### How Layers Work in Mapbox Maps
If your figure contains one or more traces of type scattermapbox, choroplethmapbox or densitymapbox, the layout of your figure contains configuration information for the map itself.

The map is composed of layers of three different types.

- `layout.mapbox.style` defines the lowest layers, also known as your "base map"
- the various traces in the `plot_ly` call signature are by default rendered above the base map (this can be controlled via the use of below attribute).
- the `layout.mapbox.layers` attribute accepts an array that defines layers that are by default rendered above the traces in the `plot_ly` call signature (this can be controlled via the below attribute).

#### Mapbox Access Tokens and When You Need Them

The word "mapbox" in trace names and the layout.mapbox attribute refers to the Mapbox GL JS open-source library. If the basemap you define using `layout.mapbox.style` uses data from the Mapbox service that requires API authentication, then you will need to register for a free account at https://mapbox.com/ and obtain a Mapbox Access token.

If you're using a Chart Studio Enterprise server, please see additional instructions here.

The following values of layout.mapbox.style DO require an Access Token:

1. `basic`, `streets`, `outdoors`, `light`, `dark`, `satellite`, or `satellite-streets` yeild maps composed of vector tiles from the Mapbox service, and do require a Mapbox Access Token or an on-premise Mapbox installation.
2. A Mapbox service style URL, which requires a Mapbox Access Token or an on-premise Mapbox installation.
3. A Mapbox Style object as defined at mapbox docs
We recommend setting your MapBox Access Token as an environment variable in your R environment. That way, your token will not be committed to version control. See Basemap Requiring MapBox Access Token

#### The following values of `layout.mapbox.style` DO NOT require an Access Token:
1. `white-bg` yields an empty white canvas which results in no external HTTP requests
2. `open-street-map`, `carto-positron`, `carto-darkmatter`, `stamen-terrain`, `stamen-toner` or `stamen-watercolor` yeild maps composed of raster tiles from various public tile servers which do not require signups or access tokens

#### OpenStreetMap Tiles, no Token Needed
This chart demonstrates how to use "open-street-map" tiles as the base map for a chart. A Mapbox Access Token is not required.


```{r}
library(plotly)

us_cities = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/us-cities-top-1k.csv")

fig_data <- us_cities 
head(fig_data)

fig <- fig_data %>% # a plotly figure object
  plot_ly(
    lat = ~lat,
    lon = ~lon,
    marker = list(color = "fuchsia"),
    type = 'scattermapbox',
    hovertext = us_cities[,"City"]) 

fig <- fig %>%
  layout(
    mapbox = list(
      style = 'open-street-map',
      zoom =2.5,
      center = list(lon = -88, lat = 34))) 

fig
```

#### Base Map Below A Trace: No Token Needed

This chart demonstrates how to use a public USGS imagery map as a base map using layout.mapbox.layers. The map is rendered below the trace.


```{r}
library(plotly)

us_cities = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/us-cities-top-1k.csv")

fig <- us_cities 
fig <- fig %>%
  plot_ly(
    lat = ~lat,
    lon = ~lon,
    type = "scattermapbox",
    hovertext = us_cities[,"City"],
    marker = list(color = "fuchsia")) 

fig <- fig %>%
  layout(mapbox= list(
    style = "white-bg",
    # zoom = 3,
    # center = list(lon = -93 ,lat= 41),
    zoom = 6,
    center = list(lon = -77.05 ,lat= 38.8),
    layers = list(list(
      below = 'traces',
      sourcetype = "raster",
      source = list("https://basemap.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/USGSImageryOnly/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}")))))

fig

```

#### Maps Below and Above A Trace: No Token Needed

This example uses the same base map below the trace as the one above.

In addition, a WMS layer map from Environment Canada (which displays near-real-time radar imagery in partly-transparent raster tiles) is rendered above the scattermapbox trace, as is the default:



```{r}
library(plotly)
fig <- us_cities 
fig <- fig %>%
  plot_ly(
    lat = ~lat,
    lon = ~lon,
    type = "scattermapbox",
    hovertext = us_cities[,"City"],
    marker = list(color = "fuchsia")) 
fig <- fig %>%
  layout(
    mapbox= list(
      style = "white-bg",
      sourcetype = 'raster',
      # zoom = 3,
      # center = list(lon = -93 ,lat= 41),
      zoom = 6,
      center = list(lon = -77.05 ,lat= 38.8),
      layers = list(list(
        below = 'traces',
        sourcetype = "raster",
        source = list("https://basemap.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/USGSImageryOnly/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}")),
        list(
          sourcetype = "raster",
          source = list("https://geo.weather.gc.ca/geomet/?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX={bbox-epsg-3857}&CRS=EPSG:3857&WIDTH=1000&HEIGHT=1000&LAYERS=RADAR_1KM_RDBR&TILED=true&FORMAT=image/png")))))

fig

```

#### Map Requiring MapBox Access Token
This example demonstrates how to use a MapBox Access token in order to use
alternative "styles", or base maps from MapBox:
"dark", "basic", and "satellite-streets",
each of which requires API authentication.

In this case, the Access Token is stored in an environment variable which is then passed to the chart configuration call signature.


```{r}
library(plotly)
library(here)

mapboxToken <- paste(readLines(here("tests","mapbox_token.txt")), collapse="")    # You need your own token
Sys.setenv("MAPBOX_TOKEN" = mapboxToken) # for Orca
```

```{r}
us_cities = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/us-cities-top-1k.csv")

fig <- us_cities 
fig <- fig %>%
  plot_ly(
    lat = ~lat,
    lon = ~lon,
    marker = list(color = "fuchsia"),
    type = 'scattermapbox',
    hovertext = us_cities[,"City"]) 
fig <- fig %>%
  layout(
    mapbox = list(
      # style = 'dark',
      # style = 'basic',
      style = 'satellite-streets',
      zoom =2.5,
      center = list(lon = -88, lat = 34))) 
fig <- fig %>%
  config(mapboxAccessToken = Sys.getenv("MAPBOX_TOKEN"))

fig

```
